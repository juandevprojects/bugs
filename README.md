Contains data and code that raise warnings or undefined behavior when using third party libraries

Sometimes running data science scripts applies transformations to the data. However, some transformations are executed with a warning. The transformed data is obtained but with some warning raised by the library.

As far as possible I want to run code without warnings raised midway.

This repository contains some examples of code execution that should run normally but raises warnings midway.
